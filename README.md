    ```
  - On macOS:
    ```shell
    brew install parallel
    ```
  
- **samtools**: A suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data. Install using your package manager:
  - On Ubuntu:
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install samtools
    ```
  - On macOS:
    ```shell
    brew install samtools
